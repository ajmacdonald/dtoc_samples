She may be the most wonderful maker of apple pies in the world, but she cannot tell how she does it—a few apples and a little sugar. So I think that the training of a reporter is primarily important; a good power of observation may come next, and brains should be used if available.</q>

That is supposed to be a slam at someone, but what other kind of farmer is there than the one who works in the dirt? The better use he makes of that dirt, the better farmer he is, the more he has to contribute to the food supplies of his neighbours in town.</q>

A man’s word was his bond, and a promise was kept to the death. Not all the real things of life are taught to the Cree by the Christian. Courage is better than culture, playing the game of more importance than the surface niceties of civilisation, to be a man now of more moment than to hope to be an angel hereafter.</q> (Cameron 199) In contrast to <persName cert="high" sameAs="Miriam Green Ellis" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/293858561">Ellis</persName>’s awestruck directness, the vision of sunset at the Ramparts, the entrance to <placeName cert="high" ref="http://www.geonames.org/5955840">Fort Good Hope</placeName>, provokes a Romantic effusion from Cameron, in which duelling emphases on aloneness and impressive pronouncement frame the scene. <q type="block">Awed and uplifted, our one wish is to be alone; the vision that is ours for one hour of this Arctic night repays the whole summer’s travel. The setting of the picture is that ineffable light, clear yet mellow, which without dawn and without twilight rises from the flowing river to starless heavens, and envelopes the earth as with a garment—the light that never was on sea or land. We could not have chosen a more impressive hour in which to pass the portal into the Arctic World.</q> (Cameron 206) While the differences in length and aim between a typescript and a published volume might challenge the feasibility of this comparison, what emerges as significant are the palpable contrasts in tone between the teacher at ease in lecturing and the journalist pursuing human interest.</ref>

The bride’s immediate revulsion, her change from love to hate, and refusal to listen to any explanation are strong indictments of prevailing prejudices.

The subtlety of the narrative inheres both in the warm relationship between the husband and his mother, who has educated him and kept the subsistence farm going in his absence, and the delayed disclosure about true parentage. Although Ellis works hard to air the views and desires of both sides of this doomed partnership, she spends most time dissecting John’s interior dilemma and ambivalence, <q>torn between his duty to his mother and his love for his wife</q> (Chap. 2, 5). Rose constantly questions, extracting protestations of fidelity and explanations about a beloved collie: <q><q>You do love me, do you not?</q></q> and <q><q>Was there another girl, John?</q></q> (Chap. 1, 4), <q><q>Who is Flossie?

But, he defended himself again, he could not tell her of himself without seeming to cast a slur on that mother, who had done so much for him</q> (Chap. 2, 1).</ref></ref></p>
