This claim would prompt few objections among critics then or now, but disagreements do exist about how these portraits should be interpreted. <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/61787936">Imre Szeman</persName> offers a point of departure with his claim that in this era the concept of nation emerged <q>pre-eminently as a strategy of reading</q> to the point that <q>in <placeName cert="high" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName> the concept of nation [was] articulated differently within literary criticism than within literature</q> (164). <ref target="#canon_formation">A splinter between criticism and literature in the articulation of nation raises the possibility that judgements of works considered central to the category of <ref target="#genre">Canadian fiction</ref> might be in part a function of overly enthusiastic criticism that stretched the fiction to represent nationalism.</ref></ref>

                                    <ref target="#genre_issue">As critics considered the meaning of <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/44317974" sameAs="Margaret Laurence">Laurence</persName>’s work, they attended to issues raised by <ref target="#theme_or_topic">English-Canadian nationalism</ref> and <ref target="#theme_or_topic"><ref target="#social_movement">second-wave feminism</ref></ref> using literary tools of their trade, including genre. Laurence’s stories, like most contemporary fiction, evinced characteristics of both <ref target="#theme_or_topic">realism</ref> and <ref target="#theme_or_topic">romance</ref>, yet most of her critics favoured interpretation as romance: any discovery of viable identities was good news for those wishing for autonomous versions of women and Canadians.

While realism cannot represent the world directly, it does give the impression of some sort of mimetic claim to a world beyond the text, despite the difficulties attached to any belief in language as being able to represent what is ultimately unrepresentable in textual form. As <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/109769875" sameAs="George Lewis Levine">George Levine</persName> suggests, <q>whatever else [realism] means, it always implies an attempt to use language to get beyond language, to discover some nonverbal truth out there</q> (6). Part of the explanatory power of realism is its capacity to account for the realities of the social and historical world. Curiously, <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/87380498">Raymond Williams</persName> understands this aspect of realism to be ultimately limiting; the world in all its manifestations is assumed to be the conditioner, even determiner, of human individuality, making realism <q>a conscious commitment to understanding and describing…the movement of psychological or social or physical forces</q> (261). Evidently, in the real world, anything can happen, but in a realist world, certain things are presumed more likely to happen, so that, for example, in the real world, a person can win the lottery, but in a realist world, that might be unrealistic.</ref>

Frye figures romance as a way of envisioning a transformation in the world, helping it along the trajectory of integration, in that <q>the mode of romance presents an idealized world: in romance heroes are brave, heroines beautiful, villains villainous, and the frustrations, ambiguities, and embarrassments of ordinary life are made little of</q> (<title level="m" cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/187010218">Anatomy of Criticism</title> 151). <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/100293806">Ian Duncan</persName> challenges the idea that romance is quite so simple or innocent as Frye suggests, in part because he sees romance as inevitably sentimental and purposeful. To Duncan, romance is the effect of history because history provides useful myths. Once <q>discovered,</q> these ancestral stories give a writer the wherewithal to recreate myths and make use of them toward new cultural ends. Romance is what Duncan calls <q>a specific historical process: the appropriation, and reinvention, of a <q>common cultural heritage</q> as individual literary property</q> (58). While realism depicts the complicated world and its constraining effects on ordinary people, romance reinvents a past to justify powerful individual action toward fulfilling current wishes.</ref>

It seems these protagonists cannot have both. At the point when Morag needs moral support to leave Brooke, her controlling husband, an unconventional lover comes back into her life in the form of Jules. He is a qualitatively different spousal figure for Morag because he shares her past, understands her as a friend, and gives her the child that Brooke refused. Jules offers a meaningful emotional connection while respecting her need for independence. He appears to be the kind of man who could accommodate an independent woman because he never expresses sexual jealousy or possessiveness. Important, too, is the fact that his acceptance of her independence does not diminish his expression of concern for her, as is clear in his reaction to her request to forego birth control: <q>Look, I didn’t say before, but you don’t want to get pregnant, do you?</q> to which Morag replies, <q>Would you mind very much if I didn’t do anything to try not to?</q> (301). His response is genial, but underscores that she is embarking on a responsibility that he chooses not to share:</ref>

Although not wittingly. I wasn’t very witting in those days, I guess</q> (69). This anguish recalls Hagar’s regret that her independence cost her the comfort of a family. Morag, too, is torn between what is important to her and what would be harmonious for her loved ones. For example, Pique’s need for an integrated family is exactly what Morag does not know how to address. Pique’s resentment about being denied a sense of belonging impedes her relationship with everyone in her life: <q>There is no way [Jules] is ever going to apologize to Pique for his absence, and to defend himself would be to knock Morag, as it was her wish originally to have Pique.

                                <ref target="#representation_of_women">It was tempting in <date cert="high" when="1978">1978</date> to see Morag as a triumphant woman: <q>Significantly, she does not wed herself to life in the form of any one of these men; as an artist she must fully experience life without enmeshing herself in it to the extent that she cannot withdraw sufficiently to write</q> (<persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/34469280" sameAs="Sherrill Grace">Grace</persName> 69–70). Alternatively, Morag as a character of realism reveals compromises often made in the social world, including the unhappiness she has visited upon her daughter in the name of her own female independence. Upon reflection, Morag’s torment due to her role in depriving Pique of a community makes her less convincing as a resolved or unified female identity. In fact, as a single mother at the head of her household, she suffers from potentially irresolvable tensions.</ref>

                            <ref target="#characterization">This view of Morag’s independence as haunted by dilemma is suggested by the plot’s organization according to Morag’s anxieties concerning Pique’s well-being. Each retrospective story about Morag’s life is prompted by her present-day anxiety about Pique, and the effect is to make Pique’s future the central dilemma of the novel. Morag’s retrospective view of her own life becomes less focused on her achievements in the public world and more concerned with her uneasiness about the happiness of her female child who despairs over not having a father in her life: <q type="block"> <q>Why did you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> me?</q><lb></lb> <q>I wanted you,</q> Morag said, stunned.<lb></lb> <q>For your own satisfaction, yes. You never thought of him, or of me.</q><lb></lb> And to that accusation there was no answer. None. Because it was partly true. To have someone of her own blood. But only partly. She had not conned a kid out of him, after all. Or not quite, anyway. How did he look at it? She didn’t know. (255) </q> Morag’s exhilaration about her own independence is routinely deflated by self-doubt, an emotional rollercoaster that dramatizes her daughter’s ambivalence about her single mother.<ref target="#representation_of_women"> Morag is not a model for Pique as a woman, and so the job of resolving contradictions has been put off to a new generation. Hagar rejects her father, and Morag loses hers. Both characters in such different times and historical circumstances choose to be single mothers who dwell on their anxieties about what they have done to their children. </ref></ref>

Like Hagar’s, Morag’s independence from conventional female roles frequently functions to subvert the patriarchal order, from women living without husbands to <ref target="#economics">women enjoying financial independence</ref>. In both novels, gender-based contradictions between independence and family betray an emphasis on unworkability. Although the <date cert="high" when="1978">1978</date> view that Pique <q>completes Morag’s existence as a woman in a way a man cannot</q> was often seen as an embodiment of <q>Morag’s understanding and acceptance of the future,</q> <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/44317974" sameAs="Margaret Laurence">Laurence</persName> presents obstacles again and again that cast doubt on the possibility of reconciliation (<persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/34469280" sameAs="Sherrill Grace">Grace</persName> 70). How are we to understand Morag in the context of her daughter? Are we to understand these realistic characters as crushed by the weight of gender roles that cannot be resolved in a way that liberates Morag from guilt and yet provides Pique with a sense of familial stability? What is lost if Morag is considered a hero—is the solution for women to jettison the happiness and emotional security of their children for the sake of their own autonomy?</ref>

                                    <ref target="#gender_issue">When Morag is deemed a symbol of independent womanhood, her independence is depicted as both desirable and possible in ways that had not worked outside of fiction. Her success in the imaginative world gives hope to women of the real world (like <persName cert="high" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/44317974" sameAs="Margaret Laurence">Laurence</persName> herself) who struggle with the same obstacles and still stare down their own guilt in the attempt to combine their own careers with raising children. Independence often signaled success to a generation of second-wave feminists, but if Morag is mired in dilemmas and unsure whether her insistence on freedom has been worth the cost, then the interpretive emphasis modulates toward realism.</ref>
